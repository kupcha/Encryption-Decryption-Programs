Call make to compile all programs

To use vencrypt:
Call "./vencrypt keyfile plaintextFile ciphertextFile" where keyfile is a .txt file containing the key, plaintextFile is the file to be encrypted, and ciphertextFile is the file the ciphertext will be written to.

Call "./vdecrypt keyfile ciphertextFile plaintextFile" where keyfile is a .txt file containing the key, ciphertextFile is file to be decrypted, and plaintextFile is the file plaintext will be written to after decryption takes place.
